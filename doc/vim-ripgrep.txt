*vim-ripgrep.txt*   Plugin that integrates rg with Vim
==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                               *rg*

This plugin is a front for ripgrep: rg. Rg can be used as a replacement for ack
or ag. This plugin will allow you to run rg from vim, and shows the results in
a split window.

:Rg[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Rg*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.
